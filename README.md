## How To Use Our Repo

To test our most recent advance, make sure to copy the file named "BasicClase" as a python file. In addition, you should have a text file named "Plates" in the same folder as the python file. You can use the Plates.txt file from the repository or create it yourself, the important thing is to keep the name intact. 

Finally, run the python file.

To prove our functionality you can load the workers cars saved in the file previously mentioned. Then you can create an object Car by inputing a plate. The app will automatically identify if the object must be created from the class ClientCar or the WorkerClass one.
Also you can see the entry time of all the cars you have added.

For full use of our program, you will need the PySimpleGUI module, so you will need to install it in your computer / execution environment. You can download it directly from this link: https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
